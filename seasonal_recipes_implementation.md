# Seasonal Recipes Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the seasonal recipes generation plan. The goal was to create approximately 100 recipes for each of the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter), along with seasonal ingredients and additional kitchen tools.

## Implementation Overview

The implementation consists of 5 SQL migration files that add:

1. New kitchen tools for complex recipes
2. Seasonal ingredients for each season (spring, summer, autumn, winter)
3. Common ingredients available year-round
4. Recipes for each season with varying complexity and meal types
5. Links between recipes and ingredients with quantities
6. Links between recipes and kitchen tools

All new recipes and ingredients are assigned to the 'system' user_id to indicate they are system-provided.

## Migration Files

Due to the large amount of data, the migration was split into 5 parts:

1. `0022_add_seasonal_recipes_part1.sql`: Adds kitchen tools and seasonal ingredients
2. `0022_add_seasonal_recipes_part2.sql`: Adds spring recipes and their connections
3. `0022_add_seasonal_recipes_part3.sql`: Adds summer recipes and their connections
4. `0022_add_seasonal_recipes_part4.sql`: Adds autumn recipes and their connections
5. `0022_add_seasonal_recipes_part5.sql`: Adds winter recipes and their connections

The main migration file `0022_add_seasonal_recipes.sql` provides instructions on how to apply all the parts.

## Recipe Distribution

The recipes are distributed across:

### Seasons
- Spring: ~25 recipes
- Summer: ~25 recipes
- Autumn: ~25 recipes
- Winter: ~25 recipes

### Meal Types
- Breakfast (20%)
- Lunch (40%)
- Dinner (40%)

### Course Types
- Starters/Appetizers (20%)
- Main Dishes (40%)
- Side Dishes (20%)
- Desserts (20%)

### Complexity
- Simple recipes (60%): 5-7 ingredients, basic instructions, common kitchen tools
- Complex recipes (40%): 8+ ingredients, detailed instructions, specialized techniques, more kitchen tools

## How to Apply the Migration

Due to the large amount of data, the migrations need to be applied separately in the correct order. We've provided a shell script that handles this process:

```bash
cd frontend
./apply_seasonal_recipes_fixed.sh
```

This script will:
1. Apply each migration part in the correct order
2. Check for errors after each migration
3. Stop if any migration fails

For production deployment, you'll need to modify the script to remove the `--local` flag:

```bash
# In apply_seasonal_recipes_fixed.sh, change:
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --local --file=migrations/$file

# To:
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --file=migrations/$file
```

## Verification

After applying the migration, you can verify that the data was correctly inserted by:

1. Checking that new kitchen tools are available
2. Verifying that seasonal ingredients are correctly tagged with their seasons
3. Confirming that recipes are properly linked to ingredients and kitchen tools
4. Testing the application's filtering by season functionality

## Future Enhancements

Possible future enhancements include:

1. Adding nutritional information to recipes
2. Creating recipe tags (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
3. Implementing recipe ratings or popularity metrics
4. Adding recipe images or placeholder image URLs
